Problem: Predicting prices of Second hand vehicles - to help buyers make better decisions. 
Three Machine Learning models and Two Deep Learning models are used to make the 'perfect' predictions. 
Of the ML models, Random Forests is the most optimal; performing better than both Linear Regression and XGBoost Models. 
Of the Deep Learning models, the Deep learning 'Large' model performs better than the DL 'small' model 
(the small & large metrics is based on the number of neurons in the architecture of the models.)

On a general scale, the Random Forest model outperforms all the other models.

Upon further tunings, results can impproved and performance might change for different models.
